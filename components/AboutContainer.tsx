        <div className="text-container">
            <p>Ms. Ohriker has been sculpting since 1989.  She works primarily in stone.  Her pieces consist of Alabaster, Agate, Marble, Limestone and African Wonderstone.  She has also worked with Acrylic, which affords a unique three-dimensional quality to a subject.  Her pieces are mostly abstract or representational as she prefers a direct approach to carving although she does have realistic pieces, such as a bust of her father, in her collection.</p>
            <p>She is the recipient of the Peacock Award and has participated in numerous exhibits in New York at LaGuardia Airport, St. John’s College, United Artists Theater at Broadway, Post College, Chelsea Center, L.I. and the Weisser Library.  She has been a member of the Alliance of Queens Artists, the Great Neck Artists’ Network, and the Catherine Lollard Wolf Art Club.</p>
            <p>Ms. Ohriker was born in Istanbul, Turkey, and lived in Holland, Italy and France before coming to the United States at the age of 8.  She is a graduate of Barnard College where she majored in Art History/Environmental Sciences.  Her first exposure to sculpting was at Columbia University, which awakened an interest to pursue further study at the Aline Geist Sculpture Workshop.</p>
            <p>The majority of her work has been acquired; however, there are several pieces available for purchase, and she may be commissioned to create a unique sculpture for a patron.</p>

            FAQ

        <div className="text-container">
            <p>How long does it take to make a sculpture?</p>
            <p><i>It depends on how complicated a piece it is.  Making a sculpture involves picking out a stone, deciding on a subject if it’s an indirect carving (something representational), or seeing where the stone takes you if it’s a direct carving (abstract).  Sometimes, it goes smoothly, but sometimes it’s more challenging.  Once you have completed giving shape to the stone (chiseling), there is the process of finishing—rasping, sanding, and polishing—before you have the final product. Then comes the mounting—this requires putting a pin in the stone so that you can anchor it to a base. On average, it usually takes me 4 to 6 months to complete a piece.</i></p>
            <p>How do you decide what to make?</p>
            <p><i>Sometimes, in the course of my everyday life, something catches my eye, and I think it would be an interesting subject to carve.  But more often, I’ve been fortunate in knowing the people for whom I’ve made sculptures, and I direct my efforts to what is relevant to them.  Each piece has a story—when my friend had a second child, her first child was 3 years old (constantly seeking her attention), so “Divided Attention” came about; when my cousin graduated from optometry school, I made “Blink”, to represent an abstract eye; I made “Underarms” and “Bikini Line” for my friend who owns a spa specializing in hair removal.  I made “Just Looking," (something I often hear in my line of work) for the challenge of carving a pair of glasses out of stone.  My sculptures have a personal appeal to their owner’s, therefore each feels their piece is special.  If I don’t have anyone in mind when starting a sculpture, I let the stone guide me, “Peak”, “Evolution”, “Gazing Up” and “Gazing Up Too” are examples of this.</i></p>
            <p>Do I have to commission a piece or are the sculptures you have for sale?</p>
            <p><i>All the sculptures that are available are so noted and certainly for sale. Otherwise, if a certain sculpture that has already been acquired appeals to you, I can make something similar (but not exactly alike). The only way it would be an exact replica would be to have it cast and bronzed and then it wouldn’t be a stone sculpture.  Each sculpture that is made of stone is unique due to the nature of stone—it is impossible to predict the grain and the intensity of color.</i></p>
            <p>How do you price your work?</p>
            <p><i>As an artist, this is my least favorite part of the process.  How do you put value on something that you’ve spent months creating? You have to calculate the cost of the materials—the larger the piece, the more the stone costs; the cost of studio time—the more complicated the piece, the longer it takes to complete; the cost of mounting—what sort of base would compliment the piece; and how much your time is worth. More often then not, by the time I factor in all the other costs, my time gets written off as a labor of love.  Needless to say, this is not considered good business, but I’ve never claimed to be a good business person, I have, however, been told I am a good artist.</i></p>
