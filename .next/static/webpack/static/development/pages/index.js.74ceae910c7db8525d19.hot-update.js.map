She works primarily in stone.  Her pieces consist of Alabaster, Agate, Marble, Limestone and African Wonderstone.  She has also worked with Acrylic, which affords a unique three-dimensional quality to a subject.  Her pieces are mostly abstract or representational as she prefers a direct approach to carving although she does have realistic pieces, such as a bust of her father, in her collection.</p>\n            <p>She is the recipient of the Peacock Award and has participated in numerous exhibits in New York at LaGuardia Airport, St. John’s College, United Artists Theater at Broadway, Post College, Chelsea Center, L.I. and the Weisser Library.  She has been a member of the Alliance of Queens Artists, the Great Neck Artists’ Network, and the Catherine Lollard Wolf Art Club.</p>\n            <p>Ms. Ohriker was born in Istanbul, Turkey, and lived in Holland, Italy and France before coming to the United States at the age of 8.  She is a graduate of Barnard College where she majored in Art History/Environmental Sciences.  Her first exposure to sculpting was at Columbia University, which awakened an interest to pursue further study at the Aline Geist Sculpture Workshop.</p>\n            <p>The majority of her work has been acquired; however, there are several pieces available for purchase, and she may be commissioned to create a unique sculpture for a patron.</p>\n            <p>Email: anita-sculpts@protonmail(dot)com</p>\n        </div>\n        <Header color=\"white\" addTopMargin={true}>\n            FAQ\n        </Header>\n        <div className=\"about-text-container\">\n            <p>How long does it take to make a sculpture?</p>\n            <p><i>It depends on how complicated a piece it is.  Making a sculpture involves picking out a stone, deciding on a subject if it’s an indirect carving (something representational), or seeing where the stone takes you if it’s a direct carving (abstract).  Sometimes, it goes smoothly, but sometimes it’s more challenging.  Once you have completed giving shape to the stone (chiseling), there is the process of finishing—rasping, sanding, and polishing—before you have the final product. Then comes the mounting—this requires putting a pin in the stone so that you can anchor it to a base. On average, it usually takes me 4 to 6 months to complete a piece.</i></p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n);"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAjBA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
