Making a sculpture involves picking out a stone, deciding on a subject if it\\u2019s an indirect carving (something representational), or seeing where the stone takes you if it\\u2019s a direct carving (abstract).  Sometimes, it goes smoothly, but sometimes it\\u2019s more challenging.  Once you have completed giving shape to the stone (chiseling), there is the process of finishing\\u2014rasping, sanding, and polishing\\u2014before you have the final product. Then comes the mounting\\u2014this requires putting a pin in the stone so that you can anchor it to a base. On average, it usually takes me 4 to 6 months to complete a piece.\")),E(\"p\",null,\"How do you decide what to make?\"),E(\"p\",null,E(\"i\",null,'Sometimes, in the course of my everyday life, something catches my eye, and I think it would be an interesting subject to carve.  But more often, I\\u2019ve been fortunate in knowing the people for whom I\\u2019ve made sculptures, and I direct my efforts to what is relevant to them.  Each piece has a story\\u2014when my friend had a second child, her first child was 3 years old (constantly seeking her attention), so \\u201cDivided Attention\\u201d came about; when my cousin graduated from optometry school, I made \\u201cBlink\\u201d, to represent an abstract eye; I made \\u201cUnderarms\\u201d and \\u201cBikini Line\\u201d for my friend who owns a spa specializing in hair removal.  I made \\u201cJust Looking,\" (something I often hear in my line of work) for the challenge of carving a pair of glasses out of stone.  My sculptures have a personal appeal to their owner\\u2019s, therefore each feels their piece is special.
