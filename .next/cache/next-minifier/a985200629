Making a sculpture involves picking out a stone, deciding on a subject if it\\u2019s an indirect carving (something representational), or seeing where the stone takes you if it\\u2019s a direct carving (abstract).  Sometimes, it goes smoothly, but sometimes it\\u2019s more challenging.  Once you have completed giving shape to the stone (chiseling), there is the process of finishing\\u2014rasping, sanding, and polishing\\u2014before you have the final product. Then comes the mounting\\u2014this requires putting a pin in the stone so that you can anchor it to a base.

You get satisfaction from having your vision come to life. I have been sculpting for over 30 years, and, for me, the most difficult part of creating an abstract sculpture is resisting my tendency to plan ahead.  What I consider some of my best pieces were a result of unexpected breakage. Unlike clay, when you work with stone, wood, or acrylic, once you take something out, you cannot put it back, so the \\u201cnegative space\\u201d becomes very important. In sculpture, as well as in life, when you work with preconceptions, you are not open to other possibilities, and it limits your ability to maximize your potential.
